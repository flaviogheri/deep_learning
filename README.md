This is a repository for my TUD course CS4240. The Assignments are not mandatory, nor so big. 
Nonetheless, this repo is where i save and update all files as to have them saved on the cloud (and more easily access them).

a requirements for the conda env has also been created as to follow the same env between the different code bases. 


For linux, to create the env. please do the following: 

```conda create --name <environment name> --file requirements.txt```

The environment was created on a win-64, but since the libraries used are commonplace, it should also be compatible with linux 22-04
